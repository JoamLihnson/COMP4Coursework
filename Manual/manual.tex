\chapter{User Manual}

\section{Introduction}
The purpose of my system is to manage a database for a chairty shop, being able to manage the items coming in, the items going out and the staff that work at the show. The intended demographic in this instance is the owner of the Hertfordshire based charity shop "Rusty Scraps", Judy Rust. The program uses a tandem of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) and a CLI (Command Line Interface) to give users access to the methods of adding donations and selling items, all while backing all of it up.

Unfortunatly, the functionality of the program is severly lacking, with no actual ability to interact with the database file in any meaningful way. For the intended audience, I personally would recommend using whatever system is currently in place for the forseeable future, as the program would not function as a appropriate alternative.
